# Tested on Tsx , New York and Canadian Mutual funds 
# The Canadian mutual fund symbols that stockwatch uses are different than what is used by most sites . 
# the StockwatchSymbols list in definitions.py must be filled in to convert mutual fund  symbols
# example 'TML202':'BIF*CDN',  my moneydance symbol is TML202 . Stockwatch uses BIF*CDN for this same fund.
# stock symbols are automaticly converted by this program from AAA.AA.A to AAA-AA-A-T or AAA-AA-A-N
# ie the stockwatch dots are converted to GlobeInvestor dashes and the exchange is tacked on the end -T is TSX -N is NYSE in newyork
# <ticker>	<date>	   <exchange>	<open>	<high>	<low>	<close>	<change>	<vol>	<trades>

# the above is the standard ASCII csv format produced by Stockwatch

# on the developers console run ----->>>execfile("updateHistoryStockwatch.py") or use runscripts.py AFTER you down load the history
# issue #1 stockwatch doesn't use fundserv mutual fund numbers so we have to convert them . example BIP151 = BRN*GLO
# issue #3 it seems to overload moneydance and lock it up. added a sleep to slow it down. but still locks uo. maybe make sure you don't have a graph on display in moneydance use the reminders page
# the above seemed to work . I removed the sleep .. looks like moneydance was trying to update the view as the history was being updated.
# MD 2019 seems to not have this problem

# words of wisdom from Sean Reilly on Jan 02 2019 
#Ah yes, sorry about that. We moved a while ago to requiring a sync/save call for snapshots to prevent an overflow of history entries which were coming from 
#calls to create snapshots which weren't meant to be saved. Anyway, you should just change any calls to security.setSnapshotInt(dateint, price) to 
#change any calls to security.setSnapshotInt(dateint, price) to invoke syncItem() on the result: security.setSnapshotInt(dateint, price).syncItem().
#I'll update the sample code now too.
