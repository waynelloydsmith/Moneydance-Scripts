In order to use these scripts you need to do a few things.
sign up with stockwatch
add the symbol "FAKE-T" to all of your investment accounts
create a TEST Investment account to play with
add all your symbols to the TEST account
after you import Investment Account transactions reconcile your cash balance against the banks.
search for any "FAKE" transactions in the account.
Because your importing .csv files the stupid idea of altering the dates AND times based on your time zone will not be a problem.
This only happens when you import quicken .qfx files and drives me nuts. (makes reconciling difficult and time consuming)
You need to create some directories for the scripts to be happy
