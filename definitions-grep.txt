BMO-Inv-new.py:             uses SymbolTable to check if the stock is not on the TSX maybe on NYSE or NEO etc
updateDaylyStockwatch.py:   uses StockwatchSymbols and StockwatchIndexs and StockPriceHistoryStockwatch
updateHistoryStockwatch.py: uses StockwatchSymbols to check for mutual fund

whats in definitions.py
StockwatchSymbols           is a dictionary of mutual funds ..  I don't have any of these any more
StockwatchIndexs            is a dictionary of currency exchange rates. like USD to CND dollars
StockPriceHistoryStockwatch is the big dictionary of all the stocks I'm tracking on the TSX and the NYSE (could be simplified .. remove the web page )
SymbolTable                 is a dictionary of Symbols that are not on the TSX like the NYSE , Venture Exchange, NEO
                            .. the second entry has to be the exchange that stockwatch uses for them
