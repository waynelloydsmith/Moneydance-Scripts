BMO-Inv-new.py:             uses SymbolTable to check if the stock is not on the TSX maybe on NYSE or NEO etc
ScotiaInvnew.py:            uses StockwatchSymbols to check for mutual fund and SymbolTable to check if its not on the TSX
updateDaylyStockwatch.py:   uses StockwatchSymbols and StockwatchIndexs and StockPriceHistoryStockwatch
updateHistoryStockwatch.py: uses StockwatchSymbols to check for mutual fund

whats in definitions.py
StockwatchSymbols           is a dictionary of mutual funds ..  I don't have any of these any more
StockwatchIndexs            is a dictionary of currency exchange rates. like USD to CND dollars
StockPriceHistoryStockwatch is the big dictionary of all the stocks I'm tracking on the TSX and the NYSE (could be simplified .. remove the web page )
SymbolTable                 is a dictionary of Symbols that are not on the TSX like the NYSE , Venture Exchange, NEO
                            .. the second entry has to be the exchange that stockwatch uses for them

*Stock-fetchhtml-Stockwatch.py:   uses StockPriceHistoryStockwatch .... table  .. with no execfile()??
*Stock-html2csv-Stockwatch.py:    uses StockPriceHistoryStockwatch.
* these scripts were dropped .. scrape-ing pages on stockwatch produced some complaints from their web master
  also getting the current price isn't much use . If your trading you need real time price . I use the trading interface for this.
