whats in definitions.py
StockwatchMutualFundSymbols           is a dictionary of mutual funds ..  I don't use these any more
StockwatchIndexs            is a dictionary of currency exchange rates. like USD to CND dollars
StockPriceHistoryStockwatch is the big dictionary of all the stocks I'm tracking on the TSX and the NYSE (could be simplified .. remove the web page )
ExchangeTable                 is a dictionary of Symbols that are not on the TSX like the NYSE , Venture Exchange, NEO
                            .. the second entry has to be the exchange that stockwatch uses for them
