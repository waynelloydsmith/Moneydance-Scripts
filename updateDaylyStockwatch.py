# the import data files should be down loaded from www.stockwatch.com and be placed in the directory /opt/moneydance/scripts/tmp/StockwatchDay
# this program processes all the .csv files in the StockwatchDay directory and moves them to /opt/moneydance/scripts/tmp/Done
# you could down load them manually but fetchhtmlDaylyStockwatch.py and fetchhtmlDaylyStockwatchIndexs.py does it for you
# to do it manually
# goto www.stockwatch.com and click on quotes->download quotes-> Date -> select Exchange -> select csv format -> submit
# you must have a stockwatch account and be logged in
# one file per Exchange . Will contain all of closing values for all of the securties on that exchange . file name can be anything that ends in .csv

# Tested on Tsx , New York and Canadian Mutual funds 
# The mutual fund symbols the stockwatch uses are different than what is used by most sites. 
# the StockwatchSymbols list in definitions.py must be filled in to convert the symbols 
# example 'TML202':'BIF*CDN',  my moneydance symbol is TML202 . Stockwatch uses BIF*CDN for this same fund.
# stock symbols are automaticly converted by this program from AAA.AA.A to AAA-AA-A-T or AAA-AA-A-N
# ie the stockwatch dots are converted to GlobeIvestor dashes and the exchange is tacked on the end -T is TSX -N is newyork
# <ticker>	<date>	   <exchange>	<open>	<high>	<low>	<close>	<change>	<vol>	<trades>

# the above is the standard ASCII csv format produced by Stockwatch

# Exchange codes used by Stockwatch
# Code 	Region 	Exchange
# U 	US 	Special code that matches any US symbol

#Ah yes, sorry about that. We moved a while ago to requiring a sync/save call for snapshots to prevent an overflow of history entries which were coming from 
#calls to create snapshots which weren't meant to be saved. Anyway, you should just change any calls to security.setSnapshotInt(dateint, price) to 
#change any calls to security.setSnapshotInt(dateint, price) to invoke syncItem() on the result: security.setSnapshotInt(dateint, price).syncItem().
#I'll update the sample code now too.
