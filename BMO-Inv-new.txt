A word about this script.
There is no list of all the possible Actions that can be thown at you in the csv files you download.
As a result every time you hit a new Action you have to edit this script.
As the years have gone by I think I've seen most of them.
I added some code today to fake a Dividend if you hit an unseen Action
Instead of raising an exception and stopping the import half way through.
The processTxn function is now recursive. I hope it doesn't run away.
The word "Fake" is appended to the memo field so you can track them down later and fix them.
Another problem is that some companies leave the Action blank so you have to guess what it is.
These are mostly REIT's posting ROC's instead of Dividends. See the ROCtable.py.
or BANK transaction see BANKtransactions.py
Sometimes the ticker is missing and I cannot find it in the descTable's so I just put in  FAKE-T.
So use the moneydance search function to look for 'fake' or 'Fake' after an import.
Also check that the cash balances reconcile.
The time stamp in the memo field now enables you to import a bunch of transactions, then search for them and delete them.
This is very handy when you have imported into the wrong account.
Moneydance does not support negative dividends so they causes problems.
Also Exchange transactions cause problems too.
Both of the above will require manual correction of the transactions after the import.
In the case of negative div's you will need to delete two transaction. or rename them.
In the case of Exchange transactions you will likely need to add a stock split and delete or edit two transaction.
moneydance stats go nuts if you post Buys or Sells with zero dollars.
