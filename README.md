These scripts are used by me almost dayly to keep my moneydance Investment accounts up to date.
runScripts.py is a Jython Java swing program that allows you too quicly choose which script you need.
I put dummy Accounts in it some of the files to post them here. 
The account numbers must be changed to match what ever your using in moneydance.
You need to put your stockwatch user name and password in two of them.(fetch...)
I also renamed the scripts runScripts-sample3.py for my own sanity.
Take the -sanple3 off the name to use it.
Take the -sample off fetch*.py file names too.
