These scripts are used by me almost dayly to keep my moneydance Investment accounts up to date.
runScripts.py is a Jython Java swing program that allows you too quicly choose which script you need.
I put dummy Accounts in it to post it here. 
The account names must be changed to match what ever is used in moneydance.
I also renamed the script runScripts-sample.py for my own sanity.
I plan on cleaning up the mess i've made here on github as time allows
