.................................................................................. update Feb 24 2025
looking at <DTPOSTED> in the downloaded .qfx files
CIBC uses noon [-5:EST]
Canadian Tire uses no time zone but fills in the hour
Scotia Bank is using my timezone now [-8:MST] or GMT-8 .. how cool
BMO is using 20250121000000.000[-5:EDT] which is midnight
Most of Ontario is using EST in the winter and EDT in the summer:
so BMO is located some where, where its summer time in February. lucky them.
so of the 4 banks only BMO is causing me a problems.
The day in my system gets shifted one day when I import the qfx.
Its is caused by the midnight thing.
The fix.
two small scripts qfxStipper.py and gfxStripper.sh
put them in /opt/moneydance/scritps
now in kde do the following
run ... kcmshell5 filetypes in a console
then add a group to applications called "Quicken data"
then under "Quicken data" general put *.qfx
then add Applications to applications/Quicken data
under "Application Preference Order" add
/opt/moneydance/scripts/qfxStripper.sh
Leafpad
Mousepad
Kate
Make sure the stripper is at the top of the list.
now open your Downloads folder with Dolphin
click on a qfx file
qfxStipper.py will run
it only looks for [-5:EDT] and changes it to ''
so if there are no [-5:EDT] in the qfx it doesn't change anything
it will create a new qfx file called filename-fixed.qfx
it will also creates a log /opt/moneydance/scripts/qfxStripper.log
now you can drag and drop the filename-fixed.qfx file into moneydance.
Since BMO is the only bank that is causing me a problem you don't need to click on the .qfx files from the other banks.
just the BMO ones. so just drag and drop the others as usual into moneydance .
if you accidentally click on a .qfx from a different bank its no big deal .
you will just end up with a copy of the original .qfx file called filename-fixed.qfx
this assumes you have Jython installed on your system.
